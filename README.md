# Olist_store_Analytics
## Introduction
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.The dataset is designed to help analysts and researchers better understand the e-commerce landscape in Brazil and identify opportunities for growth and optimization. To help Olist gain better insights into its e-commerce platform and optimize available opportunities for growth,we will perfom some KPI's and answer some business questions,thereby providing Insights and recommendations.
## Data Description
The features allow viewing orders from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment, and freight performance to customer location, product attributes, and finally reviews written by customers.
For this challenge, I used MySQL to access the dataset, clean and perform Data Analysis using BI tool Tableau.

Below is the outline of the challenge

* Explore Dataset and perform Data Validation
* Data Cleaning
* Perform KPI's Data Analysis

###  DATA EXPLORATION & VALIDATION
I explored the 9 different tables with Excel and from this process, I discovered the dataset had the following quality issues:

* Null & Empty values
* Unwanted special characters
* Irrelevant columns
* Errors in spelling
### DATA CLEANING 
In cleaning the Data, I used MySQL [link](https://github.com/Omkarnk816/Olist_store_Analytics/blob/main/Olist_CLEAN_KPIS.sql)

* Converting/Updating our category column to the English translation from the translation table.There are records in the category column that require us to replace with English-translated versions of the Portuguese strings     from the category_name_translatn table, but after confirming the distinct records from the translation table.

</p>

* Deleting the unwanted attributes/columns for the optimized analysing and reducing the time.
* Check for Null records and replace them with correct strings or numeric valuesAfter checking for null values, there are 610 records with null values in the category, name_length, descriptn_len, and photos_qty columns of the products table.I used the coalesce function to replace the null values in the category with N/A, and 0 with null values in the name_length, descriptn_len, and photos_qty columns.
